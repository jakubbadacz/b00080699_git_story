<h2>Chapter 3</h2>
<p>
    I couldn’t believe in what happened. It felt like it was my responsibility to inform the family about the loss.
    I was lucky as the address wasn’t far away from the place where the woman was shot. The adrenaline rush was filling my body from toes to head.
    After 10 minutes of fast walk, I was standing in front of the house. It seemed quite normal. I walked onto the porch.
    Then I saw that the doors were open. I knocked. Nobody answered. I decided to walk in. It got very dark as all the windows were covered with curtains.
    I walked into the living room which was on the left side from the hall that I was currently in. Nobody was there.
    Silence. From the living room I went to the kitchen, but no luck. I decided to go upstairs.
