<h1>B00080699 | The Awakening</h1>
<h2>Chapter 3</h2>
<p>
    I couldn’t believe in what happened. It felt like it was my responsibility to inform the family about the loss.
    I was lucky as the address wasn’t far away from the place where the woman was shot. The adrenaline rush was filling my body from toes to head.
    After 10 minutes of fast walk, I was standing in front of the house. It seemed quite normal. I walked onto the porch.
    Then I saw that the doors were open. I knocked. Nobody answered. I decided to walk in. It got very dark as all the windows were covered with curtains.
    I walked into the living room which was on the left side from the hall that I was currently in. Nobody was there.
    Silence. From the living room I went to the kitchen, but no luck. I decided to go upstairs.
    As I was going up, I spotted little drops of blood. Fear. When I reached first floor, more blood appeared.
    It looked like someone was dragged into one of the rooms. I walked in and saw a man and dead on the carpet with a bullet hole in his brain.
    The room was full of blood. Then I realised that there is also a crib.
    I walked up to it and saw this little baby with a shot wound at the height of its stomach. This picture couldn’t be explained in words.
    As I was looking at the baby the doors to the room closed.
    I turned my head around. There was a man pointing a gun to my head.
    I didn’t know what to do. Everything froze. He pulled the trigger and I died.
