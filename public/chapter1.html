<h1>B00080699 | The Awakening</h1>
<h2>Chapter 1</h2>
<p>Things didn't felt the same from a long time...Everything started to falling apart. I couldn't help it. Every day it got worst.
    It was 5 a.m. I was walking through the park, listening to the sound of leaves crunching underneath my feet .
    It didn't matter where I looked, everything was fading. No people in the park. I was alone. The sky was dark.
    Strings of light barely broke through the thick layer of clouds. Crows cowed in the distance.
    As I was getting closer that sound was getting more disturbing.
    There were so many of them that the sky was getting even more darker.
    This was something that Iâ€™ve never seen before. Many of them started to land on tree branches, which made trees completely black.
    On one hand I was fascinated but on the other there was something about it that made me shiver.
    I kept on walking. I walked out of the park, onto the main street. There were no cars.
    Traffic lights kept flashing orange. Tall grey buildings surrounding me with no lights in the windows.
    It felt like life left all those apartments, and the only things that were left was sadness and pain.
    Something happened. The silence had been interrupted. It was a gun shot.</p>
