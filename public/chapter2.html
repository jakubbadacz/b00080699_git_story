<h1>B00080699 | The Awakening</h1>
<h2>Chapter 2</h2>
<p>I ran in the direction of the gun shot. My heart started beating faster, I started sweating.
    I didn’t know what was coming.
    All I knew that there was a chance that somebody is still alive. I’ve reached the alley where the sound came from.
    The body was lying on the ground, in a pool of blood. It was a woman. She was about thirty years old. She was dead.
    She had long blond hair, blue jeans and a red leather jacket which had a bullet wound just right at the height of her heart.
    My mind was racing. I had so many questions, how did that happened? What did she do to deserve a faith like this?
    I was terrified. Her handback was lying just beside her. I checked it in order to find some information about her.
    Her name was Anna May. She also had an address. It may be her own. As I could not find her mobile I had no way of contacting her family.
    I’ve called an ambulance, then I decided to go to the address that she had in her purse in hope that somebody from her family might live there.</p>
